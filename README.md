# Features Extraction

This project works with the output of the OpenFace project to separate the extracted features into organised categories.

OpenFace extracts all the possible features, this project separated each feature type into a different dataset of
features, to help to work with features selection for a machine learning model. 
It also round the timestamp, so it
becomes increments of 0.04 seconds, to be consistent throughout the dataset timestamp. 


### How to use it
1. Put the .CSV files generated by OpenFace into the folder ```processed_csv/session_XX_YY```
2. Define what type of visual features you want to extract by filling and uncomment the ```main``` function on ```build_dataset.py``` file. variable name ```feature_type```. In here you need to run one feature per time.
    * Types of features supported:
        * AU
        * gaze
        * 2d_eye_landmark
        * 3d_eye_landmark
        * head_pose
        * face_2d_landmarks
        * face_3d_landmark
3. Run the file ```build_dataset.py```
The output is saved on the ```dataset/video/{{feature_type}}``` folder.


#### To extract all supported video features: 
1. Run the file ```build_dataset.py``` without change anything. 
2. The output is saved on the ```dataset/video/{{feature_type}}``` folder.
