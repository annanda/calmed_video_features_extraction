# Features Extraction

This project works with the output of the OpenFace project to separate the extracted features into organised categories.

OpenFace extracts all the possible features, this project separated each feature type into a different dataset of
features, to help to work with features selection for a machine learning model. It also round the timestamp, so it
becomes increments of 0.04 seconds.
